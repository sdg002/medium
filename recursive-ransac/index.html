            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
                In this article we will explore how we can harness the power of the RANSAC algorithm to detect multiple lines in an image.
                RANAC is a robust line detection algorithm which iteratively creates line models using a subset of points.
                Ever model is evaluated for the total count of inlier points. An inlier is defined as a point which is within
                a specified threshold distance from the line.
                evaluates the how good the model fits
                This is not a detailed description of the RANSAC algorithm
            </p>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>A noise free image on the left and the lines detected via RANSAC on the right</p>
            <img src="images/WheelSpokesNoNoiseDemo.png" />

            <p>Same image with some salt-pepper noise on the left and the lines detected via RANSAC on the right</p>
            <img src="images/WheelSpokesWithNoiseDemo.png" />

            During each iteration you are removing points, some of these points play an important role in the discovery of the subsequent lines
            The success of the recursive approach is influenced by the stopping criteria
